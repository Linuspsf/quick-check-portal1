# Quick Check â€” Interlined Lines Scheduler
- Evaluates predefined lines (multi-stop), not all OD pairs.
- Fleet sizing by peak segment load per line.
- Budget mode builds an **interlined** daily plan: assigns line cycles across multiple vessels; a vessel can serve multiple lines in one day.
- Replace demo DISTANCES (NOAA) and DEMAND (TranStats) with production sources.
